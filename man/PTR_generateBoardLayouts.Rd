\usage{
PTR_generateBoardLayouts(
  pots = NA,
  board_width = NA,
  board_height = NA,
  radius = NA,
  distance = NA,
  lbls = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pots}{The number of pots you must place}

\item{board_width}{The width of a single board.
A board is defined as one of the 2 single elements used}

\item{board_height}{The height of a single board.
See 'board_width' for details}

\item{radius}{The radius of a pot}

\item{distance}{The spacing distance between two pots.}

\item{lbls}{vector of length 'pots' consisting of custom names for each pot.
Will be assigned in from bottom-left to top-right}
}
\value{
layouts - list of layout_objects, each containing a board-plot.
Additionally, the input data and a mapping of coordinates to pot-names
plotted is returned

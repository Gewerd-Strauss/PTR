# PTR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This package includes all functions required for a simplistic determination of the required board-space for a given number of pots. 
This is by no means exhaustive, and by no means the best algorithm for this kind of packing-problem.

## Installation

You can install the development and release versions of PTR like so:

``` r
# release
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/Gewerd-Strauss/PTR@master")
# development
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/Gewerd-Strauss/PTR@dev")
```

# Documentation

A Tray-Layout can be defined given the required number of pots, their dimensions, as well as the dimensions of a board.

## Structure of a shelf

The functions in this package _technically_ work on an abstract board of any dimension. 
However, it is designed for the assumption that a `board` constitutes the area marked in green (denoted by `(3)`).
Obviously, you can just decide that a `(2)` is a board, or even `(1)`. Up to you.

```{r shelf_overview, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="An empty shelf. An entire level is marked as a '1', a side as '2' and a board as '3'."}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/shelf_overview_complete.png",rel_path = T)
```

## Defining boards for circular & square pots

```{r fdef_circle_square, echo = T, results='hide',message=FALSE}
library(PTR)
## Circular pots
circle_pots <- PTR_generateBoardLayouts2(
  pots = 64,
  board_width = 30,
  board_height = 60,
  pot_radius = 5,
  distance = 0,
  lbls = paste0("circle_", 1:64),
  pot_type = "circle"
);
## Square pots
square_pots <- PTR_generateBoardLayouts2(
  pots = 64,
  board_width = 30,
  board_height = 60,
  pot_radius = 5,
  pot_diameter = 5,
  distance = 0,
  lbls = paste0("square_", 1:64),
  pot_type = "square"
)
```
The results of `PTR_generateBoardLayouts2()` has the principal structure

```{r struct_output,eval=F}
ret
  $board_{n}
           $points      ## a list denoting the x/y-coordinates of the center point of a pot-graphic
           $board_plot  ## the plot which is the main result of the function
           $input       ## a list denoting the input data
           $version     ## an internal versioning number to be used in various function processing
```
## Defining boards for rectangular pots

Rectangular pots are defined similarly. However, they require additional arguments: 

```{r fdef_rect, echo = T, results='hide',message=FALSE}
## Rectangular Pots
rectangle_pots <- PTR_generateBoardLayouts2(
  pots = 17,
  board_width = 30,
  board_height = 60,
  pot_radius = NA,
  pot_diameter = NA,
  pot_rectangle_width = 10,
  pot_rectangle_height = 12,
  distance = 0,
  lbls = paste0("rectangle10x12_", 1:17),
  pot_type = "rectangle"
)
## Flipping the pot-dimensions 
rectangle_pots_flipped <- PTR_generateBoardLayouts2(
  pots = 17,
  board_width = 30,
  board_height = 60,
  pot_radius = NA,
  pot_diameter = NA,
  pot_rectangle_width = 12,
  pot_rectangle_height = 10,
  distance = 0,
  lbls = paste0("rectangle12x10_", 1:17),
  pot_type = "rectangle"
)
rectangle_pots_not_flipped <- PTR_generateBoardLayouts2(
  pots = 17,
  board_width = 30,
  board_height = 60,
  pot_radius = NA,
  pot_diameter = NA,
  pot_rectangle_width = 12,
  pot_rectangle_height = 10,
  distance = 0,
  lbls = paste0("rectangle12x10_", 1:17),
  pot_type = "rectangle",
  rectangle_enforce_given_orientation = TRUE
)
```

## Example Boards

The following figures showcase the first board for the example-codes above:
```{r circle_plot, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE,fig.cap="The first board for the circle-example above. Note that the x-&y-axis are not equally scaled."}
circle_pots$board_1$board_plot
```
```{r square_plot, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE,fig.cap="The first board for the square-example above. Note that the x-&y-axis are not equally scaled."}
square_pots$board_1$board_plot
```
```{r rectangle_plot, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE,fig.cap="The first board for the rectangle-example above."}
rectangle_pots$board_1$board_plot
```
```{r rectangle_flipped_plot, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE,fig.cap="The first board for the second rectangle-example above, where the pot-dimensions are flipped relative to the first one."}
rectangle_pots_flipped$board_1$board_plot
```
```{r rectangle_enforced_plot, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE,fig.cap="The first board for the second rectangle-example above, while enforcing the dimensions of 'board_width' & 'pot_width' to be locked to each other via setting 'rectangle_enforce_given_orientation=TRUE'. This option is intended to be used when rectangle-post _must_ be placed in a specific orientation, even if it doesn't fit the most pots onto a board. Notice that less pots could be fit onto the first board compared to the previous figures."}
rectangle_pots_not_flipped$board_1$board_plot
```

## Rotating Boards

Boards can be rotated via the function `PTR::PTR_rotateBoards2()`. 
```{r rotate_board_forwards, echo = T, results = 'hide', message=FALSE}
circle_pots_rotated <- PTR::PTR_rotateBoards2(circle_pots)
```
```{r circle_plot_rotated_forwards, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE,fig.cap="The first board now contains the pots of the previously-last board of 'circle_pots'. Similarly, 'circle_pots_rotated$board_2' now contains the previouly-first board of ' circle_pots'."}
circle_pots_rotated$board_1$board_plot
```

## Rotating Pots

Pots can be rotated within a board.

# PTR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This package includes all functions required for a simplistic determination of the required board-space for a given number of pots. 
This is by no means exhaustive, and by no means the best algorithm for this kind of packing-problem.

## Installation

You can install the development and release versions of PTR like so:

``` r
# release
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/Gewerd-Strauss/PTR@master")
# development
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/Gewerd-Strauss/PTR@dev")
```

If help-vignettes are to be downloaded, use instead:
``` r
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/Gewerd-Strauss/PTR@master",build_vignettes = T)
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/Gewerd-Strauss/PTR@dev",build_vignettes = T)
```

Vignettes are rendered documents discussing specific topics within a package. Installing them is recommended, but not required for utilising the package itself.


# Documentation

A Tray-Layout can be defined given the required number of pots, their dimensions, as well as the dimensions of a board.

## Structure of a shelf

The functions in this package _technically_ work on an abstract board of any dimension. 
However, it is designed for the assumption that a `board` constitutes the area marked in green (denoted by `(3)`).
Obviously, you can just decide that a `(2)` is a board, or even `(1)`. Up to you.

```{r shelf_overview, echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "An empty shelf. An entire level is marked as a '1', a side as '2' and a board as '3'."}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/shelf_overview_complete.png",rel_path = T)
```

## Defining boards for circular & square pots

```{r fdef_circle_square, echo = T, results = 'hide',message = FALSE}
library(PTR)
## Circular pots
circle_pots <- PTR::PTR_generateBoardLayouts2(
  pots = 64,
  board_width = 30,
  board_height = 60,
  pot_radius = 5,
  distance = 0,
  lbls = paste0("circle_", 1:64),
  pot_type = "circle"
);
## Square pots
square_pots <- PTR::PTR_generateBoardLayouts2(
  pots = 64,
  board_width = 30,
  board_height = 60,
  pot_radius = 5,
  pot_diameter = 5,
  distance = 0,
  lbls = paste0("square_", 1:64),
  pot_type = "square"
)
```
The results of `PTR_generateBoardLayouts2()` has the principal structure

```{r struct_output,eval = F}
ret
  $board_{n}
           $points      ## a list denoting the x/y-coordinates of the center point of a pot-graphic
           $board_plot  ## the plot which is the main result of the function
           $input       ## a list denoting the input data
           $version     ## an internal versioning number to be used in various function processing
```
## Defining boards for rectangular pots

Rectangular pots are defined similarly. However, they require additional arguments: 

```{r fdef_rect, echo = T, results = 'hide',message = FALSE}
## Rectangular Pots
rectangle_pots <- PTR::PTR_generateBoardLayouts2(
  pots = 17,
  board_width = 30,
  board_height = 60,
  pot_radius = NA,
  pot_diameter = NA,
  pot_rectangle_width = 10,
  pot_rectangle_height = 12,
  distance = 0,
  lbls = paste0("rectangle10x12_", 1:17),
  pot_type = "rectangle"
)
## Flipping the pot-dimensions 
rectangle_pots_flipped <- PTR::PTR_generateBoardLayouts2(
  pots = 17,
  board_width = 30,
  board_height = 60,
  pot_radius = NA,
  pot_diameter = NA,
  pot_rectangle_width = 12,
  pot_rectangle_height = 10,
  distance = 0,
  lbls = paste0("rectangle12x10_", 1:17),
  pot_type = "rectangle"
)
rectangle_pots_not_flipped <- PTR::PTR_generateBoardLayouts2(
  pots = 17,
  board_width = 30,
  board_height = 60,
  pot_radius = NA,
  pot_diameter = NA,
  pot_rectangle_width = 12,
  pot_rectangle_height = 10,
  distance = 0,
  lbls = paste0("rectangle12x10_", 1:17),
  pot_type = "rectangle",
  rectangle_enforce_given_orientation = TRUE
)
```

## Example Boards

The following figures showcase the first board for the example-codes above:
```{r circle_plot, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE,fig.cap = "Fig.1: The first board for the circle-example above. Note that the x-&y-axis are not equally scaled."}
circle_pots$board_1$board_plot
```
```{r square_plot, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE,fig.cap = "Fig.2: The first board for the square-example above. Note that the x-&y-axis are not equally scaled."}
square_pots$board_1$board_plot
```
```{r rectangle_plot, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE,fig.cap = "Fig.3: The first board for the rectangle-example above."}
rectangle_pots$board_1$board_plot
```
```{r rectangle_flipped_plot, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE,fig.cap = "Fig.4: The first board for the second rectangle-example above, where the pot-dimensions are flipped relative to the first one."}
rectangle_pots_flipped$board_1$board_plot
```
```{r rectangle_enforced_plot, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE,fig.cap = "Fig.5: The first board for the second rectangle-example above, while enforcing the dimensions of 'board_width' & 'pot_width' to be locked to each other via setting 'rectangle_enforce_given_orientation=TRUE'. This option is intended to be used when rectangle-post _must_ be placed in a specific orientation, even if it doesn't fit the most pots onto a board. Notice that less pots could be fit onto the first board compared to the previous figures."}
rectangle_pots_not_flipped$board_1$board_plot
```

## Rotating Boards

Boards can be rotated via the function `PTR::PTR_rotateBoards()`:

```{r rotate_board_forwards, echo = T, results = 'hide', message = FALSE}
circle_pots_rotated <- PTR::PTR_rotateBoards(circle_pots,-1)
```
```{r circle_plot_rotated_forwards, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE,fig.cap = "Fig.6: The first board now contains the pots of the previously-last board of 'circle_pots'."}
circle_pots_rotated$board_1$board_plot
```
```{r circle_plot_rotated_forwards2, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE,fig.cap = "Fig.7: The second board now contains the pots of the previously-first board of 'circle_pots'."}
circle_pots_rotated$board_2$board_plot
```

## Rotating Pots

Pots can be rotated within a board by using `PTR::PTR_rotatePots()`:

```{r pot_rotation, echo = T, results = 'hide', message = FALSE}
# positive integers shift a board to the next-up position
# negative integers shift a board th the previous position
circle_pots_pots_rotated <- PTR::PTR_rotatePots(circle_pots,shifts = 2) 
```

```{r pot_rotation_plot, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = "Fig.8: Pots are rotated left to right, bottom to top on a per-board-basis"}
circle_pots_pots_rotated$board_1$board_plot
```
```{r pot_rotation_plot2, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = "Fig.9: Incomplete Trays behave as complete trays when rotating pots."}
circle_pots_pots_rotated$board_4$board_plot
```

Note that a circular shift is not possible on a general board for `N` pots, and therefore
currently an index-based shift is used.

## Sorting Pots by Replicate-Number

Using `PTR::PTR_sortPots_by_potindex()`, you can sort pots by replicate number.
This requires two things:

- manually labelled pots
- Labels complying to the principal format `{GroupName}_{ReplicateID}`

```{r pot_randomisation, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, include = FALSE}
square_pots_with_labels <- PTR::PTR_load_dummy_data(9)
square_pots_with_labels_sorted_by_potindex <- PTR::PTR_sortPots_by_potindex(square_pots_with_labels)
```

```{r pot_randomisation_pre, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = "Fig.10: Pots with names assigned in sequential order"}
square_pots_with_labels$board_1$board_plot
```

```{r pot_randomisation_post, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = "Fig.11: Pots ordered by replicate-index"}
square_pots_with_labels_sorted_by_potindex$board_1$board_plot
```

Be aware that sorting pots via `PTR::PTR_sortPots_by_potindex()` will _recreate_ the boards from scratch.
As a result, the following order of operations 

```{r pot_randomisation_refilles_boards, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
# this step is not required, but necessary for this example. We load example 9, 
# which creates 2 boards. The latter one is not fully populated.
labelled_boards <- PTR::PTR_load_dummy_data(9)

# swap around the 2 boards. The 'incomplete' board is now in 'board_1'.
replicates_shift_boards <- PTR::PTR_rotateBoards(labelled_boards) 

# sort around the labels so that groups are uniformly distributed.
# this means that 'replicates_boards_shifted_sort_pots$board_1'
# is populated completely yet again, even though
# 'replicates_shift_boards$board_1' is not filled completely.
replicates_boards_shifted_sort_pots <- PTR::PTR_sortPots_by_potindex(replicates_shift_boards)
```

will refill `replicates_boards_shifted_sort_pots$board_1` (B), compared to `replicates_shift_boards$board_2` (A):

```{r pot_randomisation_refilles_boards_post, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = "Fig.13: board_1 prior to sorting pots by potIndex"}
#replicates_shift_boards$board_1$board_plot
```

```{r merged_plots,fig.cap = "Fig 12: (A) Board_1 after rotating boards, but before rearranging labels. (B) Board_1 after both rotating boards and rearranging labels.", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
ggpubr::ggarrange(replicates_shift_boards$board_1$board_plot + ggpubr::grids("y",linetype=1) + ggplot2::theme(plot.title=ggplot2::element_blank())
                                     ,replicates_boards_shifted_sort_pots$board_1$board_plot + ggpubr::grids("y",linetype=1) + ggplot2::theme(plot.title=ggplot2::element_blank())
                                     ,labels = "AUTO" # labels
                                     ,common.legend = T # COMMON LEGEND
                                     ,legend = "bottom" # legend position
                                     ,align = "hv" # Align them both, horizontal and vertical
                                     ,ncol = 2)  # number of rows
```

Thus, it is recommended to call `PTR::PTR_sortPots_by_potindex()` _first_, then rotate boards and/or pots.
Due to the way the sorting-function works, this minor limitation is unlikely to be resolved.

```{r LG_create_unequal_labels, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
# this step is not required, but necessary for this example. 
N <- 8
N2 <- 2
labels <- c("UU", "UG", "ABAU", "ABAG")
repeated_vector <- rep(labels, each = N)
labels_calibration <- c("cUU","cUG","cABAU","cABAG")
repeated_vector2 <- rep(labels_calibration,each = N2)
# Create the indices vector
indices <- rep(1:N, times = length(labels))
indices2 <- rep(1:N2, times = length(labels_calibration))
# Combine repeated_vector and indices using paste
labels1 <- paste(repeated_vector, indices, sep = "_")
labels2 <- paste(repeated_vector2, indices2, sep = "_")
labels_ <- c(labels1,labels2)
print(labels_) # let's display the labels we want to assign

  board_width = 30,
  board_height = 60,
  pot_radius = 5,
  pot_diameter = 5 * 2,
  pot_rectangle_width = 5 * 2,
  pot_rectangle_height = 5 * 2,
  distance = 0,
  lbls = labels_,
  pot_type = "square"
)
labelled_boards_with_unequal_groups$board_1$board_plot
labelled_boards_with_unequal_groups$board_2$board_plot
labelled_boards_with_unequal_groups$board_3$board_plot
```

```{r LG_sort_by_ID, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
